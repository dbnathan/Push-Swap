**Project Name: BSQ - Finding the largest square in a map**

**Description:**
Push-Swap is a sorting algorithm project that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using only two stacks and a set of predefined instructions. The goal is to sort the stack in ascending order using the fewest possible moves.

**How it Works:** The program takes an unsorted list of integers as input and uses a combination of predefined instructions, such as push, swap, and rotate, to sort the list. The algorithm works by dividing the list into two stacks, A and B, and then moving elements between the two stacks to sort the list.


**Features:**

    The algorithm is optimized for efficiency, with a focus on minimizing the number of instructions used to sort the list.
    The code is written in C, making it fast and efficient.

**Usage:**
The program takes a list of integers as input, which can be passed as arguments when running the program. For example, to sort the list "4 67 3 87 23":

make

./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
